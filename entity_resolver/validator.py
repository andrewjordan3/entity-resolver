# entity_resolver/validator.py
"""
This module defines the ClusterValidator class, which is responsible for
validating the membership of entities within clusters and reassigning any
entities that were incorrectly grouped.

This class uses memory-efficient, GPU-native strategies including:
- State-based pre-filtering to reduce candidate clusters.
- Chunked processing to avoid memory explosions with large cross-joins.
- Vectorized operations to minimize CPU-GPU data transfers.
- Early termination when good matches are found.

        Return a DataFrame whose buffers are *owned* by cuDF (no borrowed / zero-copy views).

        Why this exists
        ---------------
        In GPU pipelines it’s common to construct cuDF objects from CuPy arrays or from
        views of upstream columns. Those columns may be backed by memory pools (CuPy/RMM)
        that can later be reclaimed. If a downstream cleanup frees a pool while a column
        still references it, the next kernel can hit an illegal device access.

        This helper defensively re-materializes each column into a fresh cuDF-owned buffer.
        - Numeric dtypes use a fast device-side reallocation via `astype(..., copy=True)`.
        - Strings / categoricals / nested (list/struct) get a `copy(deep=True)` to ensure
          all child buffers (offsets, chars, categories, children) are duplicated.
        - The index is optionally deep-copied to avoid aliasing there as well.

        Parameters
        ----------
        input_df : cudf.DataFrame
            The DataFrame to "own-ify".
        copy_index : bool, default True
            Whether to deep-copy the index. Set False if you explicitly manage index lifetime
            elsewhere and want to avoid the extra allocation.
        prefer_numeric_astype : bool, default True
            For numeric columns, prefer `astype(same_dtype, copy=True)` (fast path). If you set
            this False, numeric columns will use `copy(deep=True)` instead (slightly heavier).

        Returns
        -------
        cudf.DataFrame
            A DataFrame with the same schema and values, whose buffers are independent from
            the inputs (safe against upstream pool releases).

        Notes
        -----
        - This function keeps the **same dtypes** and **column order**.
        - For categoricals, `copy(deep=True)` preserves both codes and category values.
        - For nested types (list/struct), deep copy duplicates all child columns.
        - This does not “defragment” VRAM; it only ensures ownership & non-aliasing.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> owned = YourClass._own_gpu_df(df)
        >>> # Now safe to release upstream pools / intermediates without dangling pointers.
